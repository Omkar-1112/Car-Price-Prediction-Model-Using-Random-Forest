# Car Price Prediction Model
## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices using the Random Forest algorithm. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and more.

## Features
<b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.<br>
<b>Model Training:</b> Using Random Forest for training the prediction model.<br>
<b>Model Evaluation:</b> Assessing the model's performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².<br>
<b>Prediction:</b> Making price predictions on new data.
## Technologies Used
<b>Python:</b> Core programming language.<br>
<b>Pandas:</b> For data manipulation and analysis.<br>
<b>NumPy:</b> For numerical operations.<br>
<b>Scikit-Learn:</b> For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.<br>
<b>Matplotlib/Seaborn:</b> For data visualization.<br>
## Setup and Installation
### Prerequisites
Python 3.x<br>
Pip (Python package installer)<br>

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include:

## Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical features (e.g., make, model).
Scaling numerical features (e.g., mileage, year).
## Model Training
The Random Forest algorithm is used for training the prediction model. It involves:

1. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
2. Training the Random Forest model on the training set.
3. Evaluating the model on the testing set using RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² metrics.
## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using:

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
RÂ² Score
